# 3D-Modeling-And-Transformations-In-OpenGL
This project uses 3D modeling and transformations in OpenGL and allows the user to control a simulated spider. The project emphasizes on using hierarchical transformations to define the moving parts of the creature.

The following is the keyboard interface I defined that controls the joint angles of the spider.

1. A, B, C, D keys: toggle which of the scorpion's RIGHT legs are active for rotation <br>
2. a, b, c, d keys: toggle which of the scorpion's left legs are active for rotation<br>
3. F/f keys: toggles when the RIGHT/left front claws are active for rotation<br>
4. T key: toggles when the tail is active for rotation<br>
5. 1,2,... keys: toggle which of the joints are active for rotation.<br>
6. X, Y, Z keys: set current rotation axis to x, y, or z axis for rotation<br>
7. Up-arrow, down-arrow keys: change the angle at the active joints<br>
8. Left mouse button click and drag motion: change the viewing angle<br>
9. O key: outputs the angle values for all the joints in the scorpion<br>
10. P key: cycles through test poses for demo<br>
11. R key: resets the model and the viewing angle<br>
12. Q key: quits<br>
